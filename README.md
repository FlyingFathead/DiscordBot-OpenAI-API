# DiscordBot-OpenAI-API
A simple Python-based Discord bot for the OpenAI API

**NOTE: This bot is heavily WIP and is currently only intended for special use case purposes. Many of the features have not been implemented yet.** For a more sophisticated project, see i.e. my [Telegram bot](https://github.com/FlyingFathead/TelegramBot-OpenAI-API/).

Although merely a crude initial sketch, this bot basis uses (as of January 2024) the up-to-date version of OpenAI's Python library (`v1.6.1`) as well as `discord.py` (`v2.3.2`).

# Installing
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/FlyingFathead/DiscordBot-OpenAI-API/` => `cd DiscordBot-OpenAI-API/`
2. Install the prerequisites: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    or:
```
discord.py==2.3.2
configparser>=6.0.0
httpx>=0.26.0
openai>=1.6.1
transformers>=4.36.2
requests>=2.31.0
```
3. Get your Discord bot token: 1) Go the Discord Developer Portal => select your bot 2) Click on "Reset Token" to generate a new one, use that.
4. Set your Discord bot token: either set it to the environment variable `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` or place it in the program directory as `discord_bot_token.txt`.
5. When setting up the bot, remember to activate this option with your bot in order for it to be able to receive messages (in the Discord `Bot` settings tab in the Developer Portal):
    ```
    Message Content Intent
    Required for your bot to receive message content in most messages.
    NOTE: Once your bot reaches 100 or more servers, this will require verification and approval. Read more here
    ```
6. Get your OpenAI API token and set it to either `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable or into `api_key.txt` in the program directory.
7. Adjust your settings in the `config.ini`
8. Launch the bot with: `python main.py`
